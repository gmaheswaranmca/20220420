Inheritance
	• Class hierarchies
	• Base classes
	• Derived Classes
	• Derived Class Definition
	• The “is a” relationship
	• Access specifier: protected
	• Function overriding
		o Polymorphism using overriding
	• Types of Inheritance
		o Single inheritance
		o Multiple inheritance
		o Hierarchical inheritance
		o Multi-level inheritance
		o Hybrid inheritance
		o Multi-path inheritance
	• Constructors in Derived Classes
	• Destructors in Derived Classes

Inheritance:
	"Generalization"
	"is-a" relationship 
	
what is inheritance?
	deriving new object from existing object 
	In c++, deriving new class(derived class) from existing class(base class)
	
base class: super class, parent class 	
derived class: sub class, child class 

derived class can be inherited from only one class. Is this possible? Yes
	-- Single Level Inheritance 
derived class can be inherited from two or more classes. Is this possible? Yes 
	-- Multiple Inheritance 
	   (Hierarchical Inheritance)
derived class can further inherited to grandchild. Is this possible? Yes 
	-- Multi Level Inheritance 
	
Hybrid 		:  
	Parent->Child. Is this hybrid? No.	but Single Level 
	Parent->Child->GrandChild. Is this hybrid? No. but Multi Level 
	Parent->FirstChild,Parent->SecondChild. Is this hybrid?No. but Multiple
	Parent->FirstChild->FirstGrandChild,Parent->SecondChild. 
		Is this hybrid? Multiple, Multilevel. Yes Hybrid.
		---> No. Hierarchical
		
	GrandParent->Son,Daughter
	Son->GrandDaughter
	Daughter->GrandSon
	[GrandDaughter,GrandSon]->GrandGranSon
			Multi Level 
			Multiple 
			Multi Path. Yes. Hybrid.
	
	Daughter is "Mama/Uncle/Mama" GrandDaughte
	GrandSon is "Bhava/Dude/Aththaan" GrandDaughter 
		
Multi-path 	:
	GrandParent->Son,Daughter
	Son->GrandDaughter
	Daughter->GrandSon
	[GrandDaughter,GrandSon]->GrandGranSon
			Multi Level 
			Multiple 
			Multi Path. Yes. Hybrid.

class definition from cppreference
	no inheritance syntax:
	(1) class-key class-head-name

			member-specification

	inheritance syntax:
	(2) class-key class-head-name : base-specifier-list

class-key : one of class, struct, or union 
	difference between 
		"class" class-key		-by default member access is private

		"union" class-key 		+by default base class access is public 
								+by default base class access is public
								-highest sized member is memory allocated
