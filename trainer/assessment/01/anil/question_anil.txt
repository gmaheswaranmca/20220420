i) Define a function 
void findDifference(const int& firstNumber, const int& secondNumber, 
	int& theDifferenceAlias)
to receive "two numbers" as "first two arguments" from the "driver function" (main function) and 
to send the "difference" of those numbers to the "driver function" using "the third reference argument"
-- 20 points 
ii) Define a function 
int findSumOfDigitsOfNumber(const int& theNumber)
to receive "a number" as argument from the "driver function" and 
to send the "sum of digits" of the given number to the "driver function" using "function return statement"
-- 25 points 
iii) Define a function 
int findMaxOfThree(const int& firstNumber, const int& secondNumber, const int& thirdNumber,
	int& minmumAlias)
to receive "three numbers" as "first three arguments" from the "driver function" and 
to send "maximum of those numbers" using the "function return statement" 
   and "minimum of those numbers" using the "fourth argument" to the "driver function"
Note: Use if..else statement to find maximum whereas use conditional operator to find minimum    
--25 points 
iv) 
The "driver program" (main function) will read the "three numbers" from the user 
as "console input" using statement "C++ cin".
You are requested to find the the "maximum" and "minimum" of those numbers 
using the function "findMaxOfThree".
Then find the "difference" betwteen the "maximum" and the "minimum" numbers 
using the function "findMaxOfThree"
Then find the "sum of the digits" of the "difference" 
Finally print the given three numbers, the minumum, maximum, "difference of minium and maximum"
and the "sum of digits of difference" one by one using the captions "First Number:",
"Second Number:", "Third Number:", "Maximum:", "Minimum:", "Difference of minumn and maximum:", and
"Sum of Digits:".
The above task (from reading three numbers to finding sum of digits of the difference
of the maximum and minimum of those numbers)  has to be done three times using "for loop".
Keep the number "3" in the macro constant "NUMBER_OF_TIMES" and use in the "for loop"

Test Case:
Input:
Enter First Number: 2022
Enter Second Number: 2050
Enter Third Number: 1882
Output:
First Number: 2022
Second Number: 2050
Third Number: 1882
Maximum: 2050
Minimum: 1882 
Difference of minumn and maximum: 168
Sum of Digits: 15	


Note:
You have to check the sum of digits is single digit using the function
bool isSignleDigit(const int &num)
and Print after the "Sum of Digits:" is printed 
Extra Output:
Yes, Signle Digit Sum of Digits.
Or 
No, Signle Digit Sum of Digits.
